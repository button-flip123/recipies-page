	<h3>Steps</h3>

	<ol>
		<li>
				<p>Make the lepinja bread dough</p>
				<p>
					Add flour to a large bowl. Create a well in the center of the flour. Add the lukewarm water and yeast.<br> Set aside for 5 - 10 minutes for the yeast to activate. Knead to combine, then add the salt.<br> Knead the dough for 5 minutes by hand or in a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Add the lard or canola oil and continue to knead for about 3 - 4 minutes or until smooth.<br> Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel or clingfilm. Set aside to proof for 45 - 60 minutes or until doubled in size.<br>
					Tip:
					The water shouldn't be too hot, or the yeast won't activate. The best water temperature is around 35°C / 95°F.
				</p>

		</li>
		<li>
				<p>Shape into balls</p>
				<p>
					Dust your working surface with flour or semolina. Place the Lepinja dough on the floured surface.<br> Shape into a log and cut into six equal parts. Shape each piece into a smooth, round ball.<br>
				    Place back on the floured surface. Cover with a kitchen towel or clingfilm and set aside to proof for 10 minutes.
				</p>
		</li>
		<li>
				<p>Shape into lepinja</p>
				<p>


					Shape each ball into a round flatbread approximately 15 cm or 6-inches in diameter.<br> 
					Place each Lepinja bread on a floured baking sheet. Leave to rest for another 10 - 15 minutes. Then, using a back (dull) side of the knife, make a mesh pattern. <br>Preheat the oven to 250 °C / 480 °F.
					<br>
					Tip:
					If you plan to bake your Lepinja bread in a pizza oven or use a pizza stone for the oven, you don't need a baking sheet.<br> Place the bread directly on the stone surface to bake.
				</p>

		</li>
		<li>
				<p>Bake</p>
				<p>
					Place the baking sheet (don't line with parchment paper) with the Lepinja bread into a preheated oven on the middle rack. <br> Bake for 8 - 10 minutes at 250 °C / 480 °F or until the flatbread is golden-brown and baked. <br> Transfer to a wire rack, gently splash with water and cover with a kitchen towel. Serve warm or at room temperature.
