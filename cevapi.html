	<h4>Description</h4>

	<p>
		Ćevapi is an old-fashioned dish that originates from almost unknown parts and is known as Ćevapičići. <br> 
		It is believed that ćevapi were introduced to Bosnian cuisine through the Ottoman Empire, which was present in the Balkan area for almost 500 years.

	<h4>Ingridiants</h4>

	<ul>
		<li><p>600 g finely minced beef (1.3 pounds)</p></li>
		<li><p>300g finely minced lamb (or pork mince if you prefer) (10 oz) </p></li>
		<li><p>3 cloves garlic, minced </p></li>
		<li><p>1 teaspoon fine salt </p></li>
		<li><p>1 teaspoon black pepper </p></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Steps</h3>

	<ol>
		<li><p>In a large bowl, combine beef, lamb, and salt (plus other spices if you so desire)</p></li>
		<li><p>Knead the mixture with clean hands for 5 minutes</p></li>
		<li><p>Cover the meat with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight</p></li>
		<li><p>Uncover the meat and stir in minced garlic and black pepper</p></li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Shape the mixture into small logs no longer or wider than an index finger  – it is best to do this with wet hands, so the meat does not stick to you. <br>Keep wetting your hands after each few that you roll
			</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>Preheat your grill. Ideally, you should use a charcoal grill</p></li>
		<li><p>Brush the grill with some olive oil</p></li>
		<li><p>Grill the minced fingers on a medium heat until evenly grilled and browned on all sides</p></li>
		<li><p>Serve warm with Turkish flatbread and freshly chopped onion (and ajvar if you have it!)</p></li>
	</ol>
